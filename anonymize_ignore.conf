# anonymize_ignore.conf - used by anonymize.py
#
# List of phrases to ignore anonymization, one PCRE format Regex per line
#
# Regex are case insensitive
#
# blank lines and lines prefixed with a hash sign (#) are ignored

# Implemented in the form of negative lookaheads as variable length lookbehind isn't implemented in Python regex engine
#
# XXX: Be careful not to add sloppy regex like .* or .+ in here as it will prevent anonymization. Use this file sparingly, it's better to code generic tested rules in to the relative subroutines where possible
#
# XXX: Also be careful to not put capturing brackets in here as it may short circuit replacement operations
#
# XXX: if adding anything to this file, it's recommended to run tests/test_anonymize.sh to see if it breaks existing stuff
#
# XXX: this currently only applies to --hostname/--domain/--fqdn as they often match non-host related things like class names in debug messages that you want to preserve for pasting in Apache Jira tickets etc
